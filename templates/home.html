    <div class="intro-text">
      I was born in <span>Catania, Italy</span>, and from a young age I was drawn to creativity, fashion, and the power of expression. Modeling opened doors for me, allowing me to collaborate with some of the most renowned designers and brands around the world. But beyond the runway and photoshoots, I’ve always believed that <span>style is about confidence and authenticity</span>.
      <br><br>
      Acting soon became another passion. With projects like <span>“365 Days: This Day”</span>, I discovered the joy of storytelling through cinema. Each role is an opportunity to explore a new side of myself, to embody different perspectives, and to connect with people through emotion and art. For me, acting is not only performance—it’s transformation.
      <br><br>
      Off-camera, I find balance in <span>fitness, travel, and culture</span>. Exploring the world, meeting new people, and experiencing different traditions continually inspire me. Staying active and disciplined helps me grow not only as an artist, but as a person who strives for passion in every moment of life.
      <br><br>
      What defines me most is my belief in <span>living fully and fearlessly</span>. Whether I’m in front of the camera, on set, or simply enjoying a sunset on the coast of Sicily, I want to bring authenticity and intensity to everything I do. My journey is about growth, expression, and sharing experiences with others.
      <br><br>
      Through modeling, acting, and personal connections, I aim to inspire people to embrace their individuality, live passionately, and never be afraid of dreaming bigger.
